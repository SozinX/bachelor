# Search engines perfomance testing
This work includes 2 independent modules to work with and requires 2 databases: mySql and PosgreSql with docker containers for Solr and Elasticsearch. I can't provide the database itself in this paper, which is about 5GB in size and the api access parameters. This job needs me to get it up and running successfully.
